# About the Experiment 

Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) is a method of   electric arc welding process in which the energy of fusion is utilized by an electric arc between the tungsten electrode and workpiece, shielding gas is focused around the electric arc which helps in protecting the weld pool from oxidation from the atmospheric air. Shielding gas such as Ar, He and CO2 is focused to the weld pool through a gas nozzle. GTAW is distinct from Metal Inert Gas and Manual Metal Arc welding because the electrode is non-consumable in GTAW and uses filler wire from external source as shown in Figure 1. GTAW can be done with or without filler material. GTAW without filler material is called autogenous welding.
